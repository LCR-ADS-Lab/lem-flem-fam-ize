to
choose
the
subject
which
you
are
interested
in
is
not
easy
specially
these
days
but
many
students
are
trying
to
get
what
they
are
interested
in
i
always
argue
with
my
friends
regardig
this
subjects
thus
i
agree
every
student
should
get
the
subject
which
he
is
interested
in
there
are
many
reasons
why
i
agree
on
this
and
the
important
reasons
are
creativity
invention
and
reflecting
the
happyness


	
first
of
all
whhen
the
student
gets
his
interisting
subjects
he
will
do
well
in
school
also
he
might
accamulate
good
marks
most
studies
show
that
the
students
who
like
his
major
will
it
appears
on
his
scoars
in
addition
he
will
be
more
active
than
the
others
because
he
will
focus
in
his
study


	
secandly
the
seccessful
studens
who
are
mostly
interested
in
thier
major
actuaully
many
evedinces
show
that
the
studens
who
love
their
major
will
be
thinker
and
they
can
create
a
lot
of
things
ii
am
sure
we
have
a
lot
of
examples
of
studens
have
became
scintests
doctors
and
engineers
just
because
they
are
more
likely
interested
in
their
majores


	
thirdly
when
the
studens
graduate
from
the
university
and
they
get
a
job
they
will
realize
how
much
important
they
are
we
all
know
that
will
reflect
very
positive
imact
on
ourselves
and
families
of
course
when
we
study
hard
and
get
good
grades
we
will
get
better
job
i
have
seen
many
people
change
their
jobs
only
if
they
do
not
find
the
job
that
they
are
looking
for


	
finally
choosing
the
major
which
you
like
needs
lots
of
efferts
but
i
am
sure
it
will
be
easier
when
you
react
with
it
i
hope
all
the
students
think
twicely
before
they
take
any
step
