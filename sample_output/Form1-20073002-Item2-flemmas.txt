when
it
come
the
question
of
which
one
be
more
important
between
interest
and
job
or
career
when
we
have
to
choose
different
people
might
have
differernt
answer
from
i
point
of
view
i
completely
agree
with
 
shooseing
 
subject
to
prepare
for
a
job
of
career
be
more
important
because
job
or
career
be
priority
and
fundation
of
i
happy
life
good
job
will
provide
i
financially
stable
and
keep
i
be
respect
or
admire
the
reason
why
i
think
so
go
as
follow



first
the
reason
for
i
view
be
that
job
or
carrer
be
priority
and
fundation
of
i
happy
life
first
of
all
i
life
in
toronto
everything
need
to
pay
by
myself
i
need
pay
hydor
bill
telephone
bill
rent
so
i
have
to
access
a
job
second
in
order
to
get
a
good
job
i
have
to
put
myself
to
the
next
level
so
i
should
study
english
and
go
to
university
in
future
if
i
have
a
good
job
i
can
make
more
money
to
pay
the
high
tution
book
fee
i
can
focus
on
study
enjoy
spare
time
with
i
friend
all
 
these
aspect
need
a
fundation
of
money



second
another
reason
for
i
view
be
that
good
job
will
provide
i
finacially
stable
for
example
if
i
have
a
good
job
i
don
not
need
loan
and
can
freely
choose
the
program
what
i
really
want
to
choose
to
learn
such
mba
programm
although
the
tution
be
so
high
when
i
have
enough
save
i
can
make
a
schedule
include
trip
to
the
whole
world
and
enjoy
i
life



finally
the
good
job
will
enable
i
repect
and

order
to
get
good
job
