when
it
comes
the
question
of
which
one
is
more
important
between
interest
and
job
or
career
when
we
have
to
choose
different
people
might
have
differernt
answers
from
my
point
of
view
i
completely
agree
with
 
shooseing
 
subjects
to
prepare
for
a
job
of
career
is
more
important
because
job
or
career
is
priority
and
fundation
of
my
happy
life
good
job
will
provided
me
financially
stable
and
keep
me
be
respected
or
admired
the
reasons
why
i
think
so
go
as
follow



first
the
reason
for
my
view
is
that
job
or
carrer
is
priority
and
fundation
of
my
happy
life
first
of
all
i
live
in
toronto
everything
need
to
pay
by
myself
i
need
pay
hydor
bill
telephone
bill
rent
so
i
have
to
access
a
job
second
in
order
to
get
a
good
job
i
have
to
put
myself
to
the
next
level
so
i
should
study
english
and
go
to
university
in
future
if
i
have
a
good
job
i
can
make
more
money
to
pay
the
high
tution
books
fee
i
can
focus
on
study
enjoy
spare
time
with
my
friends
all
 
these
aspects
need
a
fundation
of
money



second
another
reason
for
my
view
is
that
good
job
will
provided
me
finacially
stable
for
example
if
i
have
a
good
job
i
don
not
need
loan
and
can
freely
choose
the
program
what
i
really
want
to
choose
to
learn
such
mba
programm
although
the
tution
is
so
high
when
i
have
enough
saving
i
can
make
a
schedule
including
trip
to
the
whole
world
and
enjoy
my
life



finally
the
good
job
will
enable
me
repected
and
admired
because
in
order
to
get
good
job
i
have
to
get
into
university
to
get
high
education
 
learning
professional
skills
and
i
will
keep
myself
good
mannered
nice
all
these
will
enable
me
be
respected
and
admired
by
other
people



in
summay
according
to
the
reasons
i
have
discussed
 
above
it
is
a
good
idea
for
me
to
choose
subjects
to
prepare
a
job
or
career
at
first
