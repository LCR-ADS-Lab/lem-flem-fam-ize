i
agree
with
the
statement
that
it
is
more
important
to
study
subjects
we
are
interested
in
than
to
study
subjects
to
prepare
for
a
job
or
career
though
there
are
a
lot
of
subjects
we
should
study
we
do
n't
have
to
study
all
of
them
although
it
is
important
to
learn
something
for
our
job
or
career
it
is
more
important
to
study
what
we
really
wan
to
study



for
instance
when
i
think
of
my
future
such
as
job
or
career
i
want
to
work
at
the
places
where
i
really
like
for
many
years
as
i
have
wanted
to
become
a
hotel
clerk
in
the
united
states
of
america
though
i
have
to
study
english
it
is
not
bad
for
me
because
i
like
studying
english
very
much
studying
what
we
are
not
interested
in
is
sometimes
makes
us
bored
and
confused
we
ca
n't
enjoy
studying
them
in
addition
we
usually
feel
like
stopping
it
when
we
are
not
interested
in
it
on
the
other
hand
studying
what
we
like
makes
us
happy
and
enables
us
to
ldo
better
when
we
study
sbujects
we
are
interested
in
we
can
often
 
make
them
useful
for
our
future
we
should
enjoy
our
lives
studying
what
we
really
want
to
learn
and
use
them
in
our
job



studying
subjects
we
are
interested
in
does
also
us
good
when
we
need
them
for
our
job
or
career
therefore
it
is
more
important
to
choose
to
study
subjects
we
are
interested
in
than
to
choose
subjects
to
prepare
for
a
job
or
career
in
addition
it
is
