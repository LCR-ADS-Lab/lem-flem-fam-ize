to
choose
the
subject
which
you
ares
interest
in
be
not
easy
specially
these
day
but
many
student
ares
try
to
get
what
they
ares
interest
in
i
always
argue
with
i
friend
regardig
this
subject
thus
i
agree
every
student
should
get
the
subject
which
he
be
interest
in
there
ares
many
reason
why
i
agree
on
this
and
the
important
reason
ares
creativity
invention
and
reflect
the
happyness


	
first
of
all
whhen
the
student
get
he
interisting
subject
he
will
do
well
in
school
also
he
might
accamulate
good
mark
most
study
show
that
the
student
who
like
he
major
will
it
appear
on
he
scoars
in
addition
he
will
be
more
active
than
the
other
because
he
will
focus
in
he
study


	
secandly
the
seccessful
studens
who
ares
mostly
interest
in
thy
major
actuaully
many
evedinces
show
that
the
studens
who
love
they
major
will
be
thinker
and
they
can
create
a
lot
of
thing
ii
be
sure
we
have
a
lot
of
example
of
studens
have
become
scintests
doctor
and
engineering
just
because
they
ares
more
likely
interest
in
they
majores


	
thirdly
when
the
studens
graduate
from
the
university
and
they
get
a
job
they
will
realize
how
much
important
they
ares
we
all
know
that
will
reflect
very
positive
imact
on
ourselves
and
family
of
course
when
we
study
hard
and
get
good
grade
we
will
get
good
job
i
have
see
many
people
change
they
job
only
if
they
do
not
find
the
job
that
they
ares
look
for


	
finally
choose
the
major
which
you
like
need
lot
of
efferts
but
i
be
sure
it
will
be
easy
when
you
react
with
it
i
hope
all
the
student
think
twicely
before
they
take
any
step
