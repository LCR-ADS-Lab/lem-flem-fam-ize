i
have
an
eagle
in
my
country
i
give
him
a
name
it
's
fars
it
's
a
nice
name
for
the
eagle
i
am
always
spend
my
time
with
my
eagle
every
morning
when
i
get
up
i
go
with
him
for
many
places
in
the
mountain
in
to
find
some
food
for
him
i
love
my
eagle
so
much
and
i
think
he
is
also
i
miss
him
so
much
now
because
he
is
not
with
me
also
at
the
night
he
sleep
in
my
room
when
i
just
get
up
in
the
morning
i
saw
him
looking
to
my
face
and
try
to
say
good
morning
and
i
know
when
he
is
in
a
bad
mood
or
a
good
mood
in
his
face
i
hunt
birds
by
this
eagle
and
i
know
when
he
would
like
to
go
or
not
because
sometimes
when
he
is
in
a
good
mood
he
make
like
a
sound
and
move
his
wings
and
his
tail
that
's
mean
he
would
like
to
go
out
with
me
now
to
hunt
or
maybe
to
eat
