as
i
sit
here
facing
the
monitor
a
plethora
of
thoughts
continuously
replace
each
other
in
my
mind
highly
diverse
emotions
fight
each
other
for
expression
so
here
i
am
an
embodiment
of
chaotic
emotions
some
of
them
express
joy
some
express
sorrow
some
express
excitement
some
express
apprehension
some
express
determination
the
first
thought
that
comes
to
mind
concerns
this
very
writing
assignment
why
do
i
need
to
do
it
that
very
thought
is
replaced
by
one
which
says
that
there
is
a
purpose
for
everything
of
course
no
answer
is
good
enough
for
a
questioning
brain
and
as
a
result
this
series
of
questions
and
answers
continues
until
a
third
emotion
namely
frustration
creeps
in
and
tells
the
other
2
to
stop
interfering
with
other
emotions
still
to
come
this
seems
like
a
very
garbled
piece
to
me
already
but
well
it
is
my
current
stream
of
consciousness
