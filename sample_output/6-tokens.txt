keller
has
experienced
something
memorable
for
her
about
her
language
learning
i
can
say
that
human
has
the
complete
character
of
humanity
if
the
senses
of
human
are
complete
by
accident
people
can
lose
one
of
their
sense
an
can
still
survive
in
the
society
however
the
most
difficult
thing
is
the
case
of
the
author
helen
keller
who
has
lost
her
sight
and
her
hear
i
will
say
that
herself
is
memoir
sense
she
has
lost
essential
senses
the
most
important
thing
for
her
is
memoir
if
i
was
ask
first
about
what
might
be
the
possible
answers
to
educate
this
kind
of
people
i
would
n't
have
any
idea
about
that
she
did
n't
have
any
problem
with
her
touch
so
like
she
said
her
teacher
anne
sullivan
gave
her
a
doll
to
let
her
play
with
that
a
little
while
and
spelled
it
with
her
finger
