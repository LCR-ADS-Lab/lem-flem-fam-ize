i
agree
with
the
statement
that
it
be
more
important
to
study
subject
we
ares
interest
in
than
to
study
subject
to
prepare
for
a
job
or
career
though
there
ares
a
lot
of
subject
we
should
study
we
do
not
have
to
study
all
of
they
although
it
be
important
to
learn
something
for
we
job
or
career
it
be
more
important
to
study
what
we
really
wan
to
study



for
instance
when
i
think
of
i
future
such
as
job
or
career
i
want
to
work
at
the
place
where
i
really
like
for
many
year
as
i
have
want
to
become
a
hotel
clerk
in
the
united
state
of
america
though
i
have
to
study
english
it
be
not
bad
for
i
because
i
like
study
english
very
much
study
what
we
ares
not
interest
in
be
sometimes
make
we
bored
and
confused
we
can
not
enjoy
study
they
in
addition
we
usually
feel
like
stop
it
when
we
ares
not
interest
in
it
on
the
other
hand
study
what
we
like
make
we
happy
and
enable
we
to
ldo
good
when
we
study
sbujects
we
ares
interest
in
we
can
often
 
make

useful
for
we
future
we
should
enjoy
we
life
study
what
we
really
want
to
learn
and
use
they
in
we
job



study
subject
we
ares
interest
in

also
we
good
when
we
need
they
for
we

or
career
therefore
it
be
more
important
to
